## Documentaiton for Terraform modules used
- [s3-static-website](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/cn-terraform/s3-static-website/aws/latest)
  - Only manual step was adding the bundle to S3 through the console. This should be automated by a pipeline later.
- [cognito-user-pool](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/lgallard/cognito-user-pool/aws/latest)
  - [AWS Cognito API docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_CreateUserPoolClient.html) were useful for determining the values for the fields
